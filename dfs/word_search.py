# 79. Word Search
# Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.
# The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

# Example 1:
# Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
# Output: true
