# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
# Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.
# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 
# Example 1:

# Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if root == None or p == None or q == None:
            return None
        
        node = root
        
        while node:
            if max(p.val, q.val) < node.val:
                node = node.left
            elif min(p.val, q.val) > node.val:
                node = node.right
            else:
                return node
            
        return node
